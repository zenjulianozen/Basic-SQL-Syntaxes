--- You will create a stored procedure routine named UPDATE_SALEPRICE with parameters 
--- Animal_ID and Animal_Health.
--- This UPDATE_SALEPRICE routine will contain SQL queries to update the sale price of 
--- the animals in the PETSALE table depending on their health conditions, BAD or WORSE.
--- This procedure routine will take animal ID and health conditon as parameters which 
--- will be used to update the sale price of animal in the PETSALE table by an amount 
--- depending on their health condition. Suppose -

--- For animal with ID XX having BAD health condition, the sale price will be reduced 
--- further by 25%.
--- For animal with ID YY having WORSE health condition, the sale price will be reduced 
--- further by 50%.
--- For animal with ID ZZ having other health condition, the sale price won't change.
